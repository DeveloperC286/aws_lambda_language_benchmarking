# AWS Lambda Language Benchmarking - Go

## AWS Lambda - Zip File
To package up the Go source code for AWS Lambda to use, the source code needs to be compiled to a binary, and then the binary needs correctly zipped up.
The naming of the binary is irrelevant; it only needs to match the handler specified.

By default, the binaries generated by Go need no additional configuration.
To compile the binary, you need to fetch the official Lambda library and then compile for the Linux environment matching the Go Lambda runtime environment.

```sh
go get github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda
GOOS=linux go build src/main.go
zip lambda_function.zip main
```

The zip file `lambda_function.zip` can then be uploaded for usage as a Go AWS Lambda.
